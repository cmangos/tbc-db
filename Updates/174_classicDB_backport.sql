-- Fixed Lolly Quests 
/* Fixed Lolly Quests for Hallow's End event
These quests involve Jesper and Spoops. They require the player to visit
innkeepers in each capital, perform an emote and receive their lollies.
Currently the initial quest from Jesper(8311) is unavailable as are the
quests from the alliance capital innkeepers. The innkeepers also do not
respond to the correct emote to complete the quest. All of these issues
have been corrected.
Spoops has the quest(8312) available but is incorrectly designated an
innkeeper with gossip. These have been corrected. Npcs involved in these
quests have available their respective quests once quest 8312 is
accepted but are unable to complete these quests upon receiving the
correct emote. These issues have been corrected. */
